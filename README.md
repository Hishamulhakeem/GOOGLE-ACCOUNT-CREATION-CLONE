# Google Account Creation UI Clone (JavaFX)

## 📝 Description

This project is a frontend **UI clone of the Google Account Creation page**, developed using **JavaFX**, a modern Java framework for building rich desktop applications.

The aim of this project is to replicate the appearance and layout of Google's sign-up page, focusing solely on the user interface without incorporating backend or authentication logic.

The UI includes:
- First and Last Name input fields  
- Username field  
- Password and Confirm Password fields  
- "Show password" toggle (visual only)  
- Navigation buttons like “Next”  
- Placeholder links such as “Sign in instead”, “Privacy Policy”, and “Terms”

The design leverages JavaFX containers like `VBox`, `HBox`, and `GridPane` for structured layout management. Components are styled using CSS to match Google’s clean and minimal aesthetic.

This project demonstrates:
- JavaFX-based layout structuring and component organization  
- Styling UI elements using CSS within JavaFX  
- Real-world UI replication and alignment techniques  
- Responsive and modular design approaches  

Although it doesn’t include backend logic, this project can be expanded in the future to support:
- User input validation  
- Backend integration  
- Form submission and authentication  
- Real-time error handling and messaging

This clone is a great practice project for beginners looking to sharpen their frontend JavaFX skills, and it also serves as a strong addition to any portfolio showcasing UI/UX design capabilities using Java.
